The first call below does not include a directory name and provides a data.frame
of all available categories. The second call shows all the sub-directories for which
there may be tertiary sub-folders, or data.

## Top level directory


```r
library(eia)
# eia_set_key("yourkey") # set API key if not already set globally
```

Here is the top-level directory information.

## Output format

The default is to return tidy data in a tibble data frame. For `eia_dir` you can set `tidy = FALSE` to return the list returned by `jsonlite::fromJSON` without any further processing or `tidy = NA` to return the raw JSON data as a character string.

The `eia` package provides API access to data from the US [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/) (EIA).

Pulling data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) API requires a registered API key.
A key can be obtained at no cost [here](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php).
A valid email and agreement to the API Terms of Service is required to obtain a key.

`eia` includes functions for searching the EIA API data directory and importing various datasets.
Datasets returned by these functions are provided in a tidy format or alternatively in more raw form.
It also offers helper functions for working with EIA API date strings and time formats and for
inspecting different summaries of data metadata. The package also provides control over API key
storage and caching of API request results.

## Installation

Install the CRAN release of `eia` with

```{r instl1, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("eia")
```

or install the development version from GitHub with

```{r instl2, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/eia")
```

## Example

After obtaining the API key, store it somewhere such as `.Renviron` and never have
to do anything with the key when using the package. Alternatively, set it manually
with `eia_set_key()` in the current R session. Further, it can always be passed
explicitly to the `key` argument of a given `eia` function.

### Load package and set key

```{r xmpl1, eval=FALSE}
library(eia)

# not run
eia_set_key("yourkey") # set API key if not already set globally
```

### Explore the API directory

Get a list of the EIA's data directory (and sub-directories) with `eia_dir()`.

```{r xmpl2}
# Top-level directory
eia_dir()

# Electricity sub-directory
eia_dir("electricity")
```

### Get data

Get annual retail electric sales for the Ohio residential sector since 2010

```{r xmpl3}
(d <- eia_data(
  dir = "electricity/retail-sales",
  data = "sales",
  facets = list(stateid = "OH", sectorid = "RES"),
  freq = "annual",
  start = "2010",
  sort = list(cols = "period", order = "asc"),
))
```

and make a nice plot.

```{r plt}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(d, aes(x = period, y = sales / 1e3)) +
  geom_bar(col = "steelblue", fill = "steelblue", stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Annual Retail Sales of Electricity (GWh)",
    subtitle = "State: Ohio; Sector: Residential",
    x = "Year", y = "Sales (GWh)"
  )
```

The `eia` package provides API access to data from the US [Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/) (EIA).

Pulling data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) API requires a registered API key. A key can be obtained at no cost [here](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php). A valid email and agreement to the API Terms of Service is required to obtain a key.

`eia` includes functions for searching EIA API data categories and importing time series and geoset time series datasets. Datasets returned by these functions are provided in a tidy format or alternatively in more raw form. It also offers helper functions for working with EIA API date strings and time formats and for inspecting different summaries of series metadata. The package also provides control over API key storage and caching of API request results.

## Installation

Install the CRAN release of `eia` with

``` r
install.packages("eia")
```

To install the development version from GitHub use

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/eia")
```

## Example

To begin, store your API key. You can place it somewhere like your `.Renviron` file and never have to do anything with the key when you use the package. You can set it with `eia_set_key` in your R session. You can always pass it explicitly to the `key` argument of a function.

```{r example1, eval=FALSE}
library(eia)

# not run
eia_set_key("yourkey") # set API key if not already set globally
```

Get a list of available data categories provided by the EIA's API.

```{r example}
eia_directory()

eia_subcategories("electricity")
```
